# Echo Reels (a fork of Echo Arcade)

**Experimental Party voice tab:** this branch adds an invite-only, four-person
voice page to the tablet, with friends, invitations, mute/deafen and a touch
keyboard. See [voice-party/README.md](voice-party/README.md) for build requirements,
hosting and validation limits. It starts with a local demo; friends on other PCs
need a shared HTTPS deployment. Live headset and cloud deployment tests are pending.
BIG CREDITS TO THE BABS- GUY HES AWESOME AND DID 90% OF THISD
This fork of [kotorvr/echo-arcade](https://github.com/kotorvr/echo-arcade) adds a **REELS** tile: **Instagram Reels on the Echo VR hand tablet**, and a lightweight installer that installs only that tile.

- **Controls:** tap = click (like, unmute, comments), swipe up / down = next / previous reel, ≡ (top left) = menu.
- **Browser:** Google Chrome (or Microsoft Edge) in app mode with its own profile, so your normal browser is untouched. The first time, log into Instagram in the window that opens on your desktop (or sign into Chrome sync there so your saved password fills in); it stays logged in.
- **Sound:** plays on your Windows default output.
- **Watch party:** watch REELS / TIKTOK together. In the tablet's SETTINGS tab, one player taps **HOST** and reads out the 4-digit code; friends tap **JOIN** and type it. Their tablet docks on a lobby poster, opens the same tile and follows the host's video (same reel, same time, pauses with the host). Each player uses their own login; only the link and play time pass through a small relay ([`party-server/`](party-server), Cloudflare Workers free plan), never video.
- **Loader:** works without EchoLoader (e.g. with EchoRelay's `dbgcore.dll`): the installer adds a small `dinput8.dll` plugin loader when needed, and keeps another `dinput8` mod (e.g. ReShade) working as `dinput8.chain.dll`.

**Install:** download `EchoArcadeReelsSetup.exe` from Releases, run it, pick your Echo VR folder (usually found automatically), click **Install / Repair** with Echo closed, then open the tablet's gamepad tab and tap **REELS**. **Uninstall** puts everything back. If another mod tool rewrites the game data and the tab disappears, click **Install / Repair** again.

Requirements: Windows 10/11, Echo VR PC (`echovr.exe` build `1683152886`), Chrome or Edge. Nothing else: the installer brings its own Python.

What changed from Echo Arcade: `host/reels.cpp` (DevTools input), the REELS tile and `tiles=` / `browser=` / `reels_audio=` settings in the host, `loader/` (plugin loader), `installer/` (setup app and its build script). Everything else is the original project; see below.

# Echo Arcade

A new **Arcade** tab (gamepad icon) on Echo VR's hand tablet that runs **Balatro**, **Duck Hunt**, **RetroArch** (30+ systems, full menu, plus DOOM), your **movies** and your **Plex** server on the tablet screen, all by touch. It's built for private community servers. Everything runs locally on your PC and nothing is networked: only you see your tablet.

| Tile | What it runs | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Balatro: Steam original | Your own Steam copy, unmodified content, **your Steam saves and achievements** | Tap = click, slide = drag cards |
| Duck Hunt | *Duck Hunt (World).nes* from `apps\roms\nes` in Nestopia, NES Zapper on port 2 (its remap) | Dock the arcade and shoot the poster; tablet RetroPad for Start/Select |
| RetroArch | RetroArch 1.22 + cores for 30+ systems (Atari to PS2/GameCube/Dreamcast, arcade, DOS). Your ROMs appear under **Playlists**, already paired with a core | On-screen RetroPad: D-pad or **analog stick**, ABXY, L/R, L2/R2, Start/Select, MENU |
| DOOM | Shareware DOOM via the prboom core | Same RetroPad |
| Movies | Your video folders (`apps\movies` and Windows *Videos* by default) in mpv | Tap for controls: ±10/30 s, pause, seek bar, volume, subtitles, audio track |
| Plex | Movies and TV from your Plex server, direct play in mpv; resume points sync back to Plex | Link once with a code at plex.tv/link, then browse libraries, *Continue Watching*, shows, seasons and episodes |

Tap **≡** (Balatro) or **HOME** (RetroArch) for Resume / Quit to launcher / Dock. The **gear** tab is **Settings**: tablet size (0.5x to 4x, applied live; experimental), saved to `echo_tweaks.ini`. It resizes the tablet's screens (the canvases and their touch areas), not the tablet's 3D body, which stays stock size. The view (FOV) is not on the tablet: set it in `echo_tweaks.ini` (below).

### Dock on a lobby poster

**DOCK TO POSTER** (top right of the launcher, and in the ≡ / HOME menu) puts the arcade on the big lobby poster nearest you, and on every other poster of the same kind in that lobby (the game swaps the picture on the model they share). All of them take touches and shots. The tablet keeps showing it too, and **UNDOCK POSTER** gives the poster its own picture back (a server poster comes back as well). Dock works on 30 of the 36 dynamic posters of the social and combat lobbies: the curved ring over the hub, the standing posters and the big combat-lobby ones. The sideways news board is left out. Six of them (a combat-lobby set piece and four in the social lobby) are left out too: their picture face is not mapped, and on the set piece the arcade drew blank and a shot at it crashed the GPU.

- **It's a touch screen.** Poke the poster with a fingertip: tap, hold and slide work as on the tablet (cards drag in Balatro, the on-screen RetroPad works).
- **Light gun.** Where your own bullets meet the docked poster, it's a tap at that exact spot: shoot the tiles, the menus, Balatro's cards, the player controls or the RetroPad's buttons. Only your shots count, not other players'. On a RetroArch game's picture a shot is a real **light-gun** shot, aimed where it hit (see below).
- Only you see it: the picture is streamed into your game locally, like the tablet.

### Light-gun games (RetroArch)

Duck Hunt style games work with the in-game guns: dock the arcade, start the game, and shoot the docked poster. Each bullet that lands on the game's picture aims the game's light gun at that spot and pulls the trigger (shots on the side panels still press the RetroPad buttons). Tested with *Metal Combat* (SNES Super Scope, Snes9x): aim calibration, crosshair and shots all land where the bullets hit.

- It goes through RetroArch's standard light gun, on any port, so it should work with every core that uses it: NES Zapper (Nestopia), SNES Super Scope / Justifier (Snes9x), Menacer / Light Phaser (Genesis Plus GX), GunCon / Justifier (PCSX ReARMed) and others. Only Snes9x has been tried so far.
- The game needs a light gun plugged in. If a game ignores the shots, open RetroArch's **MENU** > *Controls* > *Port 1 (or 2) Controls* > *Device Type*, pick the gun (Zapper, Super Scope, GunCon...) and *Save Game Remap File*. The Super Scope, for example, is Port 2 in Snes9x.
- Leave a core's own gun option on *Lightgun* (the usual default), not *Touchscreen*/*Pointer*/*Mouse*.
- **The gun's own buttons** (GunCon A/B, Justifier special, Super Scope pause...): once you have shot at the game, the tablet's **A**, **B**, **X**, **START** and **SELECT** also press the gun's A, B, C, Start and Select. The gun replaces the RetroPad on its port, so the RetroPad alone can't reach them. They are invisible overlay buttons in the bottom-left corner of RetroArch's window, pressed with a 0.3 s touch (Time Crisis misses shorter presses).
- Tested: *Metal Combat* (SNES Super Scope), *Duck Hunt* (NES Zapper, Nestopia: the Zapper reads light off the screen, and aimed shots hit ducks), *Time Crisis* PAL (PlayStation GunCon, PCSX ReARMed: language screen with tablet A, G-Con calibration, menus and stage 1 by shooting).

**How:** RetroArch aims its light gun at a touch on its window, focused or not, and an invisible overlay (`lightgun_overlay.cfg`, RetroArch's overlay light gun) makes the touch pull the trigger, for every core and port; the same overlay holds the gun-button hitboxes. So the host injects a 0.1 s touch at the spot. The window is marked *no-activate*, so the touch never takes focus from Echo VR. A touch goes to whichever window is on top at that point, so while you shoot, RetroArch's window is brought on screen and kept on top (without focus); 3 s after your last shot it goes back behind your windows (or off screen).

`light_gun=` in `arcade.ini`:

| Value | What a shot does |
| --- | --- |
| `touch` (default) | The touch above. Echo VR keeps focus. |
| `focus` | Fallback: gives RetroArch focus, puts the Windows cursor on the spot and clicks. Focus and the cursor go back 2 s after your last shot (or when the game closes). |
| `off` | Nothing on the game's picture (no overlay either). |

**Sound** from the apps goes to the VR headset (Link / Air Link "Oculus Virtual Audio Device"), not the Windows default: each app gets its own output device, the same per-app setting as Windows' volume mixer. Change it with `audio_device=` in `arcade.ini` (`default` = Windows default).

The six tab icons are centred on the bar; the Arcade and Settings icons are drawn at build time from your game's own tab art, so they match the stock ones. See **[docs/ROMS.md](docs/ROMS.md)** for ROM folders and BIOS files.

## How it works

```
echovr.exe
 ├─ EchoLoader (dbgcore.dll) loads plugins\EchoArcade.dll
 │    • hooks the tablet UI: new tab, page switching, touch cells (MinHook)
 │    • D3D12: finds the tab's screen texture (and the poster screen) when the
 │      engine creates it and copies each new frame into it on the game's own queue
 │    • DOCK: gives the nearest lobby poster that texture through the game's own
 │      poster system; fingertips and bullet rays hit-test its curved face
 └─ starts plugins\EchoArcade\ArcadeHost.exe (dies with Echo via a job object)
        • draws the launcher and touch controls
        • captures the game window (Windows.Graphics.Capture) → shared memory
        • touches → Balatro (Lua bridge over UDP 127.0.0.1)
                  → RetroArch (network RetroPad + command port, 127.0.0.1;
                               light gun: injected touch on its window)
                  → mpv (JSON IPC pipe), Plex (plex.tv link + your server)
```

- **Tablet data:** `tools/build_arcade_tab.py` reads your game's own manifest and adds the root, navigation and page canvases, the button table (the tab plus a 32×18 grid of invisible poke cells), the 1024×574 BGRA screen texture, the tab icons, and the 1249×612 poster screen texture (held by a hidden sprite so it stays loaded). Stock resources are verified byte-identical.
- **Posters:** `tools/build_poster_table.py` (run by the tab build, and by `build.cmd` if missing) reads every lobby level's dynamic posters: their placement and the picture face of each poster model, into `native/generated/posters.h`.
- **Balatro:** `tools/prepare_balatro.py` extracts the game from your `Balatro.exe` (a fused LÖVE executable) into `apps/balatro/`. It never writes to the Steam folder. The game then runs on LÖVE 11.5 with a small touch bridge (`bridge/arcade_bridge.lua`) appended to `main.lua`.
- **Supported build:** `echovr.exe` with timestamp `1683152886`. The runtime checks the executable and every hooked function's bytes at startup, and disables itself (logging the reason) on any mismatch.

## Install

Requirements:

- Windows 10/11 x64.
- An Echo VR install with **EchoLoader** (the `dbgcore.dll` + `echoloader.json` setup used by community servers).
- Visual Studio 2022 with *Desktop development with C++*.
- Python 3.10+.
- Balatro on Steam, if you want the Balatro tile. *Duck Hunt (World).nes* in `apps\roms\nes`, for the Duck Hunt tile.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install zstandard==0.25.0 pillow texture2ddecoder
.venv\Scripts\python tools\setup_apps.py        # LÖVE, mpv, RetroArch + 30 cores, DOOM shareware
.venv\Scripts\python tools\prepare_balatro.py   # finds Balatro.exe in your Steam libraries
.\build.cmd                                      # EchoArcade.dll, ArcadeHost.exe, runs the IPC test
# close Echo VR, then:
.venv\Scripts\python tools\install.py install --game "C:\path\to\ready-at-dawn-echo-arena"
```

Start Echo VR, open the hand tablet and press the **gamepad** tab (far left). The first open starts the host; after that the launcher appears.

To uninstall, close Echo VR and run `tools\install.py restore`. It puts back the original manifest (hash-checked) and `echoloader.json`, and removes the package and plugin files. Backups are kept in `backups\`.

After changing code, run `build.cmd` and then `tools\install.py update`. That refreshes the plugin, host and config without touching the tablet data. When the tablet data itself changes (as it did for DOCK), `update` says so: close Echo VR and run `tools\install.py reinstall` (restore, then install). Re-run `prepare_balatro.py` after Steam updates Balatro.

Put your ROMs in `apps\roms\<system>\` (see [docs/ROMS.md](docs/ROMS.md)); the playlists rebuild every time RetroArch opens. Video folders are set by `movies=` in `plugins\EchoArcade\arcade.ini`.

**Adding a ROM set:** `tools\import_roms.py "<set>.zip" <system>` unpacks a set (including zips nested inside it) into `apps\roms\<system>\`.

**FOV tweak:** `plugins\EchoArcade\echo_tweaks.ini` sets `[fov] x=` / `y=` multipliers (1.0 to 2.0; below 1.0 would cut off the edges of the view), edited only in that file, the same idea as EchoVR-Haptics' FovMultiplier, so you don't need that tool (it replaces EchoLoader; see Troubleshooting). Keep x and y equal (e.g. 1.4) for recordings; stretching one axis looks warped. The install seeds it from an old `haptics_config.txt` if present and never overwrites your edits.

**Plex privacy:** linking stores a Plex token in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EchoArcade\plex.json`, never in the repo or the logs. *Unlink Plex* at the bottom of the Plex library list removes it. Streams go straight from your server to this PC.

## Test without a headset

`tools/fake_game.py` stands in for Echo VR: it keeps the heartbeat alive, pokes cells, answers DOCK like a lobby would, sends poster touches and shots, and saves the tablet frame as a PNG.

```powershell
dist\EchoArcade\ArcadeHost.exe --standalone
.venv\Scripts\python tools\fake_game.py tap 757 423      # DOOM tile
.venv\Scripts\python tools\fake_game.py tap 876 38       # DOCK TO POSTER
.venv\Scripts\python tools\fake_game.py poster 170 420   # a fingertip on the docked poster
.venv\Scripts\python tools\fake_game.py shot 990 300     # a bullet on the docked poster
.venv\Scripts\python tools\fake_game.py snap frame.png
```

`build.cmd` also runs `poster_math_test`: for every poster, touches and bullet rays at known points of its face must land on the right screen pixel.

## Troubleshooting

- The logs are `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EchoArcade\runtime.log` (in-game plugin) and `host.log` (launcher and apps).
- **Arcade tab shows but does nothing, and there's no `runtime.log`:** the plugin never started. Run `tools\install.py status`. If `echoloader dll: False`, another mod (e.g. the EchoVR-Haptics/FOV tool) replaced `bin\win10\dbgcore.dll`. Put EchoLoader back from `https://files.echovr.de/updates/dbgcore.dll` (the Echo VR Installer's source).
- **Arcade tab missing:** check `runtime.log` for `unsupported echovr.exe` or `signature mismatch`. Another tablet mod (e.g. the DOOM/MUSIC tab) uses the same slot; restore that one first.
- **Tab opens but shows the "STARTING…" splash forever:** look for `stream:` lines in `runtime.log`. `screen texture created` and `frames uploaded` should both appear.
- **Balatro only reacts to some taps:** on a profile that hasn't finished Balatro's tutorial, Jimbo's tutorial blocks everything except its own prompts. Tap **Skip >** (top right) or his speech bubble.
- **DOCK says "No lobby poster here"**: dock works in the social and combat lobbies, not in matches. **"Could not find your hands"**: touch the tablet once (that starts the fingertip tracking) and press DOCK again.
- **Docked, but the poster keeps its picture or touches/shots miss:** `runtime.log` has `posters:` and `light gun:` lines (where you were, which poster, where each shot went). Send those.
- **Light-gun shots don't register:** `host.log` has `light gun:` lines (where each shot went on the desktop, and whether another window was on top of RetroArch there). Check the game has a gun plugged in (above), or try `light_gun=focus`.
- **App windows** sit behind your other windows at the top-left of the desktop. Set `window_mode=offscreen` in `plugins\EchoArcade\arcade.ini` to move them off-screen.

## Status

On the desktop, every tile has been driven end to end through the real host, capture and input paths using `fake_game.py`: launching, touch input, pause menu and clean quit for all four tiles, and DOCK, poster touches and shots through the host. The RetroArch light gun (both modes, desktop and off-screen windows) was driven the same way with *Metal Combat* while another window kept focus. The in-game DOCK (poster texture override, fingertip and bullet hit-testing) is built from the game's code and data but hasn't been tried in a lobby yet. Report `runtime.log` with any issue.
